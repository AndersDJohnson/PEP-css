# PEP-css
CSS bridge for [jQuery PEP][PEP]. Work around the [admitted limitations](https://github.com/jquery/PEP#polyfill-limitations).

This lets you use the [PEP] attribute syntax but from CSS in supported browsers so in those cases you don't have to load or execute [PEP] JavaScript and you get native behavior & performance.
